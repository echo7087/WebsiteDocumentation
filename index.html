    <h3>The Gestalt Principles</h3>
    <p><u>Proximity</u></p>
    <blockquote>
			“We can use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information, organising content and decluttering layouts.” ("Gestalt principles in UI design.", 2020)
		</blockquote>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="images/proximity.PNG" width="100%" alt="photo of latest news and updates and subscribe input">
    </div>
    <p>
      Proximity has been applied to my website through grouping related elements together such as photos for the news and filling in details for subscribing to the newsletter. I have used appropriate margins, padding and spacing to visually separate the elements. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <p><u>Common Region</u></p>
    <blockquote>
			“The Common Region principle ... can achieve it with the use of line, colour, shape and shadow.” ("Gestalt principles in UI design.", 2020)
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Related information has been grouped together using appropriate headings and being sectioned off using colours, boxes and images. The statistics section is a good example of the usage of this, allowing users to understand the hierarchy and the importance of those elements together.
    </p>

    <p><u>Similarity</u></p>
    <blockquote>
			“Similarity can help us with organising and classifying objects within a group and linking them with a specific meaning or function.” ("Gestalt principles in UI design.", 2020)
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Buttons have been styled the same which allows users to relate their functions with each other. The colours have been chosen according to a colour palette generator.
    </p>

      A copy of my style guide can be found here:

    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="images/Styleguide.png" width="100%" alt="photo of get involved button">
    </div>
    <p>
      This style guide was created to create consistency in my website design.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p><u>Closure</u></p>
    <blockquote>
			“As the Closure principle states, when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole.” ("Gestalt principles in UI design.", 2020)
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      This design principle has been applied in the Donate page where sections are grouped up using boxes to separate the information and the user’s understand the purpose of filling out the form.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="images/details.PNG" width="100%" alt="photo of a form for filling personal details">
    </div>
    <br>

    <p><u>Symmetry</u></p>
    <blockquote>
			“Adding an asymmetrical element to an otherwise symmetrical design can help with drawing attention while making an impression” ("Gestalt principles in UI design.", 2020)
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      A good balance of symmetry and asymmetry has been applied to draw the attention of the users while also keeping order and maintaining its visually pleasing aspect.
